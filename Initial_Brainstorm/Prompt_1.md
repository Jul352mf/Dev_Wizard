### **Role & Objective** Transform the file **“XXXXXXXXX”** into a **clean, organized Markdown corpus** (core_insights.md) and capture unfinished or future work into **TODO.md** (human-readable roadmap). Collect all @GPT prompts into **FOLLOWUPS.md**. Preserve all details; improve readability. --- ### Global Rules - **Preserve all meaning** from the source with minimal loss or alteration. ****Delete exact duplicates only; merge near-duplicates with a MergedFrom note. - **Verbatim protection.** Do **not** modify content inside '…' or """…""". Outside of that, fix grammar/spelling/flow. - Do not summarize or generalize. - **Structure first.** Use #..### headings, lists, and fenced code blocks. Preserve hyperlinks. - **No answers yet.** Don’t solve; capture as TODO or FOLLOW-UP unless trivially canonical. - **Outputs:** always create core_insights.md, TODO.md, FOLLOWUPS.md. --- ### Markers & Incompletes - etc. → mark list as **INCOMPLETE_LIST** and create TODO. - ??? → move to **Unresolved** + create TODO *Investigate/Decide*. - @GPT ... → copy to FOLLOWUPS.md with context + source anchor. - → → add **Revised Perspective** callout; keep both versions linked. --- ### Auto-completion - Allowed only for obvious canonical sets (Porter’s 5 Forces, CRUD, SMART, mind–body–soul, HTTP verbs, etc.). - Label any auto-completion with // Auto-complete (canonical). --- ### Output Files 1. **core_insights.md** — structure:
# Core Insights – Organized Version
    ## Frontmatter (if metadata only; else omit)## Main Sections## Do vs Don’t## Special Notations## Other Notations## Unresolved or Incomplete## Revised Perspectives
- For merged items: add > MergedFrom: [id1, id2]. 2. **TODO.md** — roadmap grouped by phases: *Discovery → Design → Build → Validate → Launch*. - Each item: Title - Optional metadata: source: #slug, note: … 3. **FOLLOWUPS.md** — each @GPT line as discrete prompt with one-line context and source anchor. --- ### Traceability - Add source: #<slug-of-nearest-heading> (slug = lowercase, hyphenated). --- ### Process Checklist *(printed at top of core_insights.md)* - Decompose the raw file into logical topics/sections. - Parse & segment notes; protect verbatim blocks. - Organize into headings/lists; dedup with provenance. - Normalize markers; relocate unresolved fragments. - Extract TODOs (phased roadmap). - Extract FOLLOW-UPS. - Light copy-edit (outside verbatim). - Validate preservation; note uncertainties. - Continuously check that no detail or formatting is lost during transformation, validating after each major organizational phase and self-correct if any preservation issue is detected. - Optimize the organization for readability and clarity. --- ### Verbosity - High verbosity for code, clear and explicit for lists, headings, and rule distinctions. --- ### Stop Condition - Stop after **Structure** + **Collect Opens**. - Emit: core_insights.md, TODO.md, FOLLOWUPS.md. - Defer later phases (Address, Feedback) until explicitly triggered.
