# Dev Wizard Brainstorm

- Also I have an idea we have soo many things that we need to keep track of. Urls, links, env vars, api keys, registry etc. Plus we have so many commands, services, modules deployments etc. How should we manage all this? are there tools for this? It would be nice to have everything in one place. We can solve this in many ways if there is no tool for it. We can use a google/excel sheet, create our own local dev UI with a small DB and terminal access where we can manage and view the structured data points we have and run tasks with the press of a button. Create a PRD draft for this subproject and a open questions doc where I can fill in all the gaps so we can send a full PRD to copilot cloud run agent and let him build this thing.
- Okay I just took a shower and thought about this tool
- First of all since we are building an AI agent system it only makes sense we built our dev software capable to interact with it so lets also make it a MCP.
- Okay this means we have three parts in this project backend and two interfaces:
    1. Backend dockerized but run locally for local file access etc.
        - Local dockerized postgres db
    2. Custom frontend - first local standalone and later we can integrate it into the bigger jagi-oap.
        1. Next.js app with shadcn components modern, futuristic & playful ui with dark mode as default and purple/violet accents. Make it look very pretty with glass and hover effects.
        2. Swiss-inspired **Typography**
        3. UI density: mixed
    3. MCP thingy
        1. Lets use the mcp sdk. Intuitivly I would go with the ts sdk because our frontend is ts as well but other mcp and langgraph stuff in general is in python so maybe better python to make sure they can communicate easily. So we need to figure out is there any downside to it.
        2. the MCP should expose a port publicly so the cloud run agents can connect to it.
- Do you see what I see this is not only a dev project management tool this can easily evolve into a local ai agent interface and later even in the seed for an ai to create and manage its own workspace in a vm.
- Okay this means the initial hardcoded command pallet with a simple UI for my lazy ass evolved into a dynamic workspace manager that . This means we need to define the scope exactly.
- Sope draft:
    - Core idea a tool that can run all kinds of things that need to be run or done many times while developing ts/js/py projects across multiple projects
    1. Version
        - Simple but production ready backend api with basic frontend no expectation to work with anything else lets start with a standalone version to make debugging easy and we can focus on the core of our system first. But built with modularity and compatibility in mind and as an app of our Monorepo. Like we use the same tech stack and if we orient ourselves on langgraph/chain, MCP standards and schemas but we openly explore how to mange and build it best before trying to wire up the rest. Also it is important to note that the core of this idea will always need some local capabilities.
        - How to kill complexity?
            - Only working for windows and one default Tech stack → see todos
            - auth with other providers is handled by the user and if not setup it just shows an error and gives a link to the page or the command to run to login the machine/session.
            - No multistep cli commands like nothing that actually opens a cli and asks to choose or input something. For all this the user is prompted to do that. But we either provide him with a prompt including relevant context for an ai that walks him through the steps based on current docs and infos.
            - We focus on running local dev servers only first
            - We assume the user has the basic coding setup needed to work with py/ts
    2. Version
        - In this version we add deployments and other features that are out of scope for the initial MVP version.
        - When all this is done we plan the full integration with our jagi-os-core and jagi-oap we need to figure out if we make a local UI version or if we just have a local execution runtime that talks to the cloud. The later is easier but the first one is more secure and leverages local compute.
    3. Version
        - This tool should be usable for everybody with no prerequisites in coding or environment setup. Like if VScode isn’t installed it downloads it for the user and sets up a default setting. It is basically a gamified developer process optimized for the absolute vibe coding experience. The tool even creates its own email [jules.solutions](http://jules.solutions) email address.
- User flows:
    - Start
    1. Start app through desktop icon
        1. If first use:
            - Welcome message explaining how everything works
            - Prompted to create a new profile with
            - Short tutorial that guides the user through their first project initialization / import
        2. Else:
            - User can create a new profile with username, email and password or login to a profile
    2. Profile creation
        1. Form
            - username
            - password
            - Path to where Dev wizard should create his folder for everything that is nice for the user to have access to his profiles dev-wiz-profile-config.json file where all defaults and settings can be edited and outputs from the tool. Like reports, logs etc. It can be another way to communicate with the user.
            - Main dev folder path (optional) - if added then the tool runs in the background and tries to identify projects and services/apps in this folder and adds them to the added project table below.
            - If no main dev folder path provided, a project is outside of the main dev folder path or it wasn’t automatically found the user can press the “Add Project” button to provide the repo root path of a project.
                - Then the service/app are surfaced automatically and/or manually
            - If still no project provided he can start a new one or import from github
                - If a new project button is pressed the setup comes up where the user can choose his techstack and service/app structure and then the scaffolding is generated automatically using CLIs of the used technologies
            - The user can then approve/edit his defaults of the commands and required env vars which are prefilled based on the projects added.
                - These are prefilled by parsing the standard files/folders with relevant data such as but not limited to, .git, packages.json, task.yml, requirements.txt etc. What other files should we check?
            - After setting all of this up the project is created and the user can optionally run a test.
                - Which results are logged in the Dev wizard folder
            - Then the login to all needed 3rd party services can be done
    
    1. Well then the user can basically do whatever his heart desires in the platform now 
    
    - Pages
        - Login (only shown at program start)
        - Dashboard (in sidebar)
            - Has a table with the users previously setup projects and above the table it has a “New Project” button. Every project entry has a “Open Project” button that links to the projects page.
        - Project page (in sidebar)
            - Project Dashboard (in project sidebar)
                - Has a table with all the projects services and a general overview about the project.
            - Actions page (in project sidebar)
                - Here we can:
                    - Start, shutdown dev servers
                    - Assign env vars to the projects services/apps
                    - (re)deploy selected services and or projects
                    - add, commit and/or push changed files in project to GitHub, create new branches, issues and what ever else is useful for GitHub (based on default and custom defaults) etc.
                    - Create new services/apps for the project
                    - update/sync environments dependencies
                    - Run tests (all or specified)
                    - Clean, reset caches
                    - Add, create, edit, rearrange or delete actions
            - Deployments Local & Cloud (in project sidebar)
                - Dashboard (in deployments sidebar)
                    - A few useful metrics like deployments, running, crashed, sleeping, failed deployments
                    - Color coded table of all deployments with useful stats inspired by the docker desktop dashboard. We should dockerize everything we can anyway soo maybe we can also just use docker desktop for alot of things like just ask docker yo whats up? (quite literally)
                        - Every deployment has a “inspect” button that opens up a “side component” like a big card that slides in from the side not a full you know this is often done in UIs in similar contexts.
                            - Here the user can redeploy, update or
                    - Button to generate up to date llm summary of most recent outputs of all deployments
                - Logs page
            - Secrets page
                - Here the user can store add and edit all the secrets and other vars for his project and assign them to the projects services/apps using a table with text fields, dropdowns etc. with a dev/staging/prod toggle at the top
                - The projects .env files are populated with the values in here and all the deployments env vars also updated. This is the ultimate source of truth for the projects.
            - Config page
                - Here toggles can be turned on and off for all the projects configs structured by services/apps
            - Settings
                - Can edit defaults on project level
        - File editor
            - File tree in a colapsable component on the left side
            - the editor shows the files rendered or in raw and allows edits of the raw and rendered files. We don’t have to code this ourselves I am sure there are prebuilt things for stuff like that. If we can’t find anything useful we defer this part and just let the
        - Settings
            - Can edit defaults globally
            - Login and integration of 3rd party tools
- @GPT suggest a good way to solve the multiple sidebar issue I saw it done elegantly before. You can do it I believe in you and trust your best judgment. No need to ask me about it.
- Intuitively I know that the tasks tool plus a csv or preloaded env vars is basically that minus the frontend and the MCP functionality. But this would more or less solve the core we want to solve. But we do that and its still a hassle plus the way we plan it now it is way more than that anyway. And we are in the age of agentic ai so lets dream big and deliver even bigger. This app is in itself a very simple thing and has probably been done by many developers in their own way. But I am tired setting up the same stuff over and over again and for ai we need tools as simple as possible anyway so if we can setup automated python/ts project setups and managing based on the users preferences why the hell not.
- First of all we need to find out if there are already tools that do this or parts of it. We don’t want to build something from scratch. We want to wire together useful tools and give them one home. So we want to find every existing open source tool that we can use to do parts of it but automated and triggered from our UI/terminal.
- Everywhere it makes sense we need a info icon that shows a description on hover next to the title.
- Full support for projects that have a blend of python, JavaScript and typescript.
    - this means it can also work with all the diffrent languages / filetypes associated with it like html, json, xml, csv,
- Since we plan to integrate this into the Jagi platform in general and the jagi-oap frontend specifically maybe we should actually start there and just add a workspace page to the UI but lets do that on a different branch (which is no problem because github cloud agent automatically creates a new branch but lets make sure it has a meaningful name and not just “copilot329042834xxxxx” or something similar)
    - We need to figure out how to add this to our existing Monorepo. We could add it to packages\tools or just treat it as a new app. Or even a mix of both? But in the end its only a tool for our bigger system and in the apps we currently have jagi-mcp-gateway, jagi-oap and jagi-os-core on the other hand it is a full app with its own backend and a shared frontend plus an MCP
- Also we can bake in LLm calls into this thingy as well since we have it connected to our runtime anyway this means we can call agents we could even spin up a local runtime and have agents run in this tool. This would give this tool the little edge because it doesn’t only follow strict deterministic processes but has some wiggle room to smooth over complex stuff. For example it would be a pain in the ass to keep all the pnpm commands up to date across multiple version but our tool doesn’t need to know all the commands for this but for every project/service these commands are setup once and even then we can use ai like github copilot cloud run to give us all the commands that work we save them and thats it. Do you understand where I am going with this?
- Give it the ability to spawn VMs
- GitHub auth through CLI
- IMPORTANT: Why do we need profiles, when jagi-oap users are already registered and logged in after phase 2? Because we need an additional layer of security here. The sensitive data handled by this system should never leave the local machine! Also to make it easier to have multiple workspaces and maybe even let agents create their own workspaces/projects with this tool. Plus if only the password hash is stored stored locally after account creation it is super secure. You know what lets go even a step further and We want pretty good security here so GnuPG? Or how should we do it? lets also make the auth between any other cloud service and this local tool PG security
    - Okay I just researched this a bit an PG doesn’t really make sense here or at least
    - 
    - Here is how we can actually do it:
        - **Local tool (super secure access)** → **OS-native keychain + hardware-backed auth**
            - Use **macOS Keychain**, **Windows DPAPI**, or **Linux Secret Service** for credential storage.
            - Combine with **Passkeys / FIDO2 / YubiKey** for unlocking and user auth.
            - Bonus: Wrap CLI in **sudo or TOTP challenge** if root/admin actions are exposed.
        - **Cloud↔Cloud↔Local communication** → **mTLS with short-lived credentials**
            - Use **Google IAM + Workload Identity Federation** or **mTLS with service accounts** for trust.
            - Rotate keys automatically via **Secrets Manager** or **Identity Tokens (OIDC)** from metadata server.
            - Avoid static secrets; always use **ephemeral tokens**.
            - Use **Google IAM + Workload Identity Federation**
- IMPORTANT: Our philosophy is that we copy, reuse and adapt everything we can find that isn’t nailed down to our advantage. We build a tool that orchestrates and executes services tools and commands so lets keep our actual backend to a minimum. It is equally important that we build this thing as modular as possible so we can integrate it seamlessly into our jagi stack. These two principles mean that we first need to check what is out there that comes closest to what we want to build. Then we see what different parts are already solved and locally accessible through our means. Then we plan our architecture and modularize it inelligently. If services need restructuring we rather just adjust the output form it for our needs then to refactor a 2000 line repo. Small tweaks in open source software are of course most likely still needed but if we have the choice to wrap or refactor we wrap.
- We want feature flags to maximize modularity.
- Okay we also need a feature matrix to keep track of all that!
- Hmmm the more I think about it I realize that this is actual automation work we are basically prepping our system by abstracting its usage to the max so users and AI agents can navigate it easily and intuitively. So since we have LangGraph as our automation framework (sooo we do need a small local runtime) we should work with docker containers. But we want to keep the ai use inside this tool to a minimum and if need it have modular graphs for these flows because this should be a toolbox for ai agents.
- We always want to work with the newest technology so make sure you use the latest stable version and only bump them down if there are conflicts and bumping the deps up doesn’t work.
- The tool only opens one terminal window and executes all “*stop-start*, *pulsed”* commands **(I lack better words to describe it) in that window. Stuff that needs a continuous terminal is done in a new tab of the first window.

# Default tech stack based on Jagi project

## **1. High-Level Architecture**

- Monorepo (pnpm workspaces) combining:
    - jagi-oap (Next.js 14 App Router frontend)
    - jagi-os-core (Python LangGraph runtime)
    - Prebuilt / local agent dirs under `MyPrebuilt/`
- External agent services (separate repos) integrated via HTTP + MCP + LangGraph deployments.

## **2. Core Technology Stack**

Frontend:

- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
- React Server Components + Client Components
- Supabase auth (`@supabase/ssr`)
- Theming via `next-themes` Runtime / Agents:
- Python 3.x with LangGraph (CLI + runtime patterns)
- `uv` for Python env + dependency resolution (fast lock/build) Inter-Process Protocols:
- HTTP JSON APIs
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) via proxied endpoints
- Streaming (SSE) for tool outputs / agent events Package & Build:
- `pnpm` workspaces
- TypeScript project references
- Likely ESLint + (maybe) Prettier (confirm in repo) Environment Management:
- Node: `.env.local` for frontend
- Python: per-component .venv managed by `uv`
- Never expose secrets via `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` unless intentionally public

## **3. Repository Layout (key areas)**

- jagi-oap: UI, API routes, hooks (`src/hooks`), feature modules (`src/features`), reusable components (`src/components`)
- jagi-os-core: LangGraph runtime code & CLI usage
- `MyPrebuilt/`: Local cloned agent repos (each self-contained Python env)
- docs + runbooks: Operational guides (e.g. MCP gateway runbook)
- pm: Planning, roadmap, decisions, build logs

## **4. Frontend Conventions**

- API routes live under `src/app/api/<segment>/route.ts`
- Use server routes as controlled proxies to external services (inject headers, hide secrets)
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` only for non-sensitive config
- Dark mode: rely on CSS variables, avoid hardcoded `bg-white`
- Hooks abstraction pattern: `useX()` separated from UI components
- If adding external service: create `src/lib/<service>.ts` and optionally a proxy under `/api/<service>`.

## **5. Python LangGraph Runtime**

- Activated via: Activate.ps1 (Windows)
- Build/deploy using Python CLI: `python -m langgraph_cli build`
- Dev mode: `langgraph dev --no-browser`
- Agents integrate via deployments list consumed by OAP (likely `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENTS` or similar)

## **6. Agent Integration Patterns**

Pattern categories:

- RAG service: proxied via `/api/rag/*` using `LANGCONNECT_API_URL`
- MCP Tools Agent: Called through an MCP server URL (`/api/oap_mcp` proxy)
- Supervisor / Orchestrator: Exposed through LangGraph endpoints or custom POST tool invocation Guiding rule: Always route browser calls → Next.js API proxy → external service (for auth, CORS, logging).

## **7. Environment & Config**

Typical env vars (examples):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_SERVER_URL`
- `LANGCONNECT_API_URL` (server-only ideally)
- `ARCADE_API_TOKEN` (server-side) Add new secret:
1. Add to server runtime config (.env / hosting platform)
2. Add placeholder to .env.example
3. Avoid leaking via client bundle

## **8. MCP Integration**

- Frontend calls `/api/oap_mcp/*`
- Proxy injects auth headers if required
- Streaming: ensure `Content-Type: text/event-stream` pass-through
- Tools discovery: `GET /tools` expected JSON list

## **9. API Design Conventions**

- Thin proxy layer
- Consistent error envelope (prefer `{ error: { message, code } }`)
- Timeouts + retries handled server-side rather than client loops
- Log: method, path, latency, upstream status, sanitized errors

## **10. Testing (assumed; verify)**

If adding tests:

- Frontend: likely Vitest or Jest (confirm existing config)
- Python agents: pytest (if present)
- Add integration tests for new API routes hitting mock upstream Call out missing: If no test harness exists, bootstrap minimal Vitest.

## **11. Logging & Observability**

- Add structured logs in proxies (request id, path, duration)
- For streaming endpoints: log open + close + error boundary
- Avoid logging raw payloads containing secrets

## **12. Security Practices**

- Never pass tokens to client
- Validate all external input (query/body) before forwarding
- Rate-limit if exposing public endpoints
- Sanitize error messages returned to UI

## **13. Adding a New App (Node / TS Service)**

1. Create folder under `apps/<new-app>`
2. Add package.json with proper `name` scope
3. Add `tsconfig.json` extending root base
4. Register in pnpm-workspace.yaml if not using glob
5. Implement service (e.g., Fastify or Next.js if UI needed)
6. Add any new env vars to .env.example
7. Document in changelog.md + build-log.md

Example scaffold:

```
{
  "name": "@jagi/jagi-new-service",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "ts-node src/index.ts",
    "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.json",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {},
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.4.0",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.2"
  }
}

```

```
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "strict": true
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

## **14. Adding a New External Service Integration (Frontend)**

1. Create proxy route: `src/app/api/<service>/route.ts`
2. Centralize fetch logic: `src/lib/<service>.ts`
3. Provide hook: `src/hooks/use<PascalService>.ts`
4. Add feature module UI under `src/features/<service>/`
5. Add environment variables & doc update

## **15. Streaming / SSE Pattern**

- Use `new ReadableStream` in route to pipe upstream events
- Flush headers early
- AbortController for client disconnects

## **16. Developer Workflow Summary**

- Install: `pnpm install`
- Dev (frontend + core runtime): `pnpm dev`
- Agent local dev: `cd MyPrebuilt/JAGI-<Agent>; uv venv && uv sync`
- Activate runtime: Activate.ps1 then LangGraph commands
- Validate new API: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/<route>`

## **17. Common Pitfalls**

- Mixing server/client contexts (e.g., using `process.env` directly in client JS)
- Forgetting to proxy auth headers → 401 from external service
- Hardcoding light mode colors
- Running JS LangGraph CLI on Windows (use Python CLI)

## **18. New App Fit Checklist**

- [ ]  Package scoped `@jagi/<name>`
- [ ]  No secrets in client bundle
- [ ]  Env var added to .env.example
- [ ]  Proxy pattern followed (if external calls)
- [ ]  Logging (method, path, latency)
- [ ]  Tested basic error + success paths
- [ ]  Documented in changelog.md
- [ ]  Added build/run instructions (README or service section)

## **19. Assumptions (Verify)**

- Testing framework presence (Jest/Vitest) not confirmed
- Styling system (likely Tailwind) not enumerated in snippet—confirm before extending
- Linting rules (ESLint config) not shown—conform to existing rather than new rules

## **20. If You Want to Start Now**

Decide: (a) New UI feature in jagi-oap or (b) new service under apps. Reply with which path + target functionality and I can scaffold next step.

Need anything deeper (e.g., SSE proxy template, MCP tool invocation flow)? Just say which area.

# Further notes:

Okay this default architecture above is a bit dated but since we want to use our tool for this project first it should be definitely compatible with it. Otherwise lets include additionally the latest stable versions and the 2 next common ones to make the first version already kind of generally capable
