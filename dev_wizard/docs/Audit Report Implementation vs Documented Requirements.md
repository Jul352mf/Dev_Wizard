Audit Report — Implementation vs. Documented Requirements (Dev Wizard)
1. Scope
Assessed current scaffold (e.g. page.tsx, page.tsx, config samples, verification script, top-level READMEs) against canonical docs:

PRD: PRD.md & PRD.md
Architecture: architecture.md, architecture.md
Roadmap: roadmap.md, roadmap.md
Security strategy (not shown in provided excerpts → status unknown)
Survey: survey.md
Feature config sample: features.example.json
Verification script: verify-docs.sh
Repo README: README.md, app README: README.md
If a file or implementation detail was not included in the supplied excerpts, it is marked “Unverified”.

2. High-Level Status Summary
Area	Status
Documentation scaffold (canonical + local copies)	Present (verified by scripts/verify-docs.sh)
Feature flags (sample)	Sample only; no runtime loader found
Environment matrix	Example referenced (verified by script); actual file contents not shown
Backend API (projects/tasks)	Declared in README.md; implementation not shown → Unverified
Project scanning	Not implemented (no code references)
Secrets management	Not implemented
Task automation integration (mise/Taskfile)	Not implemented (no adapters present)
Dev server control	Not implemented
MCP integration	Not implemented (flag mcpIntegration disabled; no code)
Command palette (Ctrl+K)	Not present
Single navigation drawer pattern	Not visible in provided UI (dashboard page is standalone)
Decision log auto-generation	Not implemented (no code hooking changes to decisions.md)
Security controls (OS keychain, FIDO2, mTLS)	Not implemented (flags disabled; no modules)
Tests (unit/integration)	None shown
CI workflow (lint + docs verification)	Not shown → Unverified
Schema files (features.schema.json)	Referenced in sample; missing in provided excerpts
Electron integration	Declared in README; no code excerpts → Unverified
Database layer (PostgreSQL / SQLite fallback)	Not shown → Unverified
Logging/observability	Not implemented (no telemetry wrappers)
Feature flag API exposure	Not implemented (no loader/utilities)
Environment/feature alignment with JAGI blueprint	Conceptually referenced; runtime usage absent
3. Detailed Gap Analysis (by PRD Functional Areas)
Project Management

UI: Static list in page.tsx (mock array).
Missing: CRUD flows, persistence, scanning, import logic.
Task Automation

Static mock tasks in page.tsx.
Missing: execution engine, status streaming, integration with mise / Taskfile / process manager.
Secrets Management

No UI, no backend endpoints, no keychain abstraction (flag secretsManagement enabled in sample but unused).
Dev Server Control

Status badges in dashboard are static; no process orchestration layer.
MCP Integration

Flag mcpIntegration disabled; no protocol adapter / server.
Feature Flags Runtime

Only sample config features.example.json; no TypeScript service to read/validate/serve it.
Environment Matrix

Example file existence inferred via verify-docs.sh; no parser or UI surface.
Command Palette & Navigation Drawer

Not present (no layout component or command palette provider).
Decision Logging

Requirement to auto-append to decision log (PRD) not implemented; no instrumentation.
Security Strategy Items

OS keychain, FIDO2, mTLS, audit events not scaffolded.
No placeholder interfaces for future integration.
Telemetry / Observability

No tracing, logging abstraction, or metrics layer.
API Layer

Endpoints listed in README.md but implementation code not provided. Cannot confirm fulfillment or data modeling.
Testing & Quality Gates

No Jest/Vitest config, no test files.
No smoke tests for API or UI behavior.
Electron Wrapper

Mentioned in README; code not provided → Unverified.
Accessibility & UX Requirements

No evidence of keyboard shortcuts, ARIA roles, or command palette scaffolding.
4. Roadmap Phase Coverage
Roadmap Phase Item (Design / Build)	Expected	Observed	Status
Wireframes / layout pattern	Layout + drawer	Single page only	Missing
Feature flag + env schemas	JSON + YAML + schema files	Example JSON only; no schema file included	Partial
API & data model design	OpenAPI / tRPC / models	Not shown	Missing
Security strategy enactment	Threat model → stubs	No stubs	Missing
MCP integration foundation	Placeholder module	None	Missing
Project scanning service	Watch + parse	None	Missing
Task execution abstraction	Adapter layer	None	Missing
Secrets storage abstraction	Interface + stub impl	None	Missing
Testing harness	Config + sample test	None	Missing
CI pipeline (docs + lint)	Workflow	Not shown	Unverified
Decision log automation	Hook + writer	None	Missing
5. Config & Schema Observations
$schema reference in features.example.json points to ./features.schema.json which is absent (gap).
No validation script or schema enforcement (e.g. JSON Schema, Zod).
No environment variable template alignment check beyond simple presence (script does not validate semantic keys).
6. Risk Assessment
Risk	Impact	Current Mitigation	Recommendation
Scope drift (many unimplemented core primitives)	Delays MVP	None	Freeze scope to 5 MVP capabilities and implement vertical slices
Missing backend foundation	Blocks real data	None	Scaffold minimal Express/TRPC layer with typed models next
Security deferred entirely	Later rework, audit failures	None	Add placeholder keychain & audit modules now
Lack of feature flag runtime	Hard-coded logic later	None	Implement loader + typed accessor early
No test harness	Regressions undetected	None	Introduce Vitest + a single sample test
Absent decision log automation	Loss of rationale	Manual docs only	Add event-based logger for config changes
7. Recommended Immediate Actions (Sequenced)
Add schema + loader: features.schema.json, config/loadFeatureFlags.ts (validate + cache).
Implement minimal envMatrix.ts parser for environments example.
Scaffold backend API (projects/tasks) with in-memory store + types; add one Vitest spec.
Introduce layout with navigation drawer + placeholder command palette provider.
Create services/decisionLog.ts to append structured entries to decisions.md.
Add Electron scaffold (main process + preload) if not already present.
Add security placeholders: security/keychain.ts, security/audit.ts.
CI workflow: run verify-docs.sh, lint, typecheck, test.
Add feature integration test: fetch /api/projects and assert shape.
Document assumptions and gaps in decisions.md (new ADRs: feature flag runtime approach, deferred MCP).
8. ADR & Documentation Gaps
No ADRs specific to Dev Wizard decisions (contrast with platform-wide decisions.md which is outside the standalone app scope).
Need ADRs for: choice of Electron + Next.js packaging strategy, feature flag implementation method, security abstraction phasing, test framework selection.
9. Verification Script Coverage Limits
verify-docs.sh only checks file presence and a few key strings; it does not:

Validate JSON schema correctness
Ensure parity between canonical and local copies
Confirm functional endpoints
10. Overall Assessment
Current state is an early visual stub with documentation scaffold and config samples. None of the core functional, security, or architectural runtime behaviors described in the canonical documents have been implemented beyond static placeholders.

11. Pass/Fail Summary (MVP Readiness)
Fail — Not yet an executable MVP per documented requirements.

12. Next Reporting Trigger
After completing steps 1–5 in “Recommended Immediate Actions”, re-run audit focusing on:

Presence & correctness of runtime loaders
Working API endpoints
Initial test harness
Decision log automation evidence
